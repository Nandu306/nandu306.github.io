          Hi there! 👋🏽 My name is Nandu and I help companies (both big and small) solve problems. When not wearing my MBA hat or sharpening my product/coding skills or building a <a href="https://mojo-learning-labs.fly.dev/" target="_blank">cool side project</a>, you can find me reading a detective novel in a Berlin café.</p>

        <p> I write about building human-centred products and the things I've picked up along the way <a href="/articles/">here</a>.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.azubiafrica.org/" target="_blank">🏜 Azubi Africa</a></h3>

            Azubi, backed by Deutsche Bildung, provides upskilling courses in coding and web development in West Africa. Since the business model in place was success-based, I explored products that would increase job placement and generate additional upfront revenue streams for the business. The work not only involved big-picture strategic analyses but also touched on various aspects of the product development lifecycle.

Areas covered: Product Development, Design Thinking, Market and Competitor Research, UX/UI, Product Vision/Strategy and Financial Analysis

            An online assignment-setting tool for school teachers. Students are invited via
email and can join classes that are available for their year group at their
school. Teachers can create classes as required and set assignments consisting
of various questions (including an image) and answer choices. Students receive
grades upon assignment submission and teachers obtain a markbook with
student performance and average scores.
