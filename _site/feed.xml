To put it in a nutshell: I just finished teaching my first semester at a university (or as the German system goes: a university of applied sciences). It wasn’t exactly pre-planned; the opportunity, in all honesty, fell into my lap and I embraced it as another useful addition to my portfolio of skills and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From leading case sessions to conducting mini-workshops to responding in real-time to issues that sprang up, I thought I’d pen down some things that I’d learned, observed, and mulled over as a new lecturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/teaching.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/teaching.png&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of a business case&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-learnings&quot;&gt;New learnings:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 In an academic environment where the go-to tool was the traditional lecture, basing my teaching pedagogy around the case method was certainly a risk-ridden move, more so because I was unfamiliar with the student body. Being ‘audacious’ showed me that I have the capacity to go with the flow and, with time, I’ve become comfortable with my ability to do so. Of course, preparing beforehand for the case and the case method was crucial and provided an invaluable structure, but the reality of teaching is that you can’t plan everything to a T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 There is a lot of uncertainty that surrounds the classroom experience and that’s one reason why the traditional lecture still dominates. I felt much more in control with a lecture and less dependent on external factors (e.g. student participation or preparation). In any case, given the long class sessions (2.5 hours), I opted for a 50:50 split between lecture and case during a class. Did the strategy work well? I’d say it worked positively with an MBA class but not so much with a postgrad course (presumably because the former had paid more, had some work experience, and was more invested in the course); I found myself having to pivot from the case method for one class very early on due to low engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Teaching, in essence, is creative problem-solving, with the end goal of enabling students to learn the material in a way that suits them best. There was a fair amount of trial and error when trying to achieve this, especially as I was working in a non-selective environment. For example, when I realised that full-blown cases just weren’t resonating with some students, I tried shorter cases that could be read during class time. And when the topic was more practical and hands-on (design thinking), then the tool of choice was a workshop-style design activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Teaching is also about performance and storytelling. A gamut of facial and body expressions generally run through the class at various points: interest, enthusiasm, boredom, arrogance, disinterest, and cynicism. Having a thick skin through all of this to deliver your lesson plan takes a toll, especially if you are dealing with difficult or disruptive students, and I can only hope that this experience has moulded me for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Given that my class was mostly international with varying ability levels and backgrounds, I had to juggle different cultural norms and understandings of personal space. I don’t have a clear solution to this, but going forward, I intend to address this on the first day of a course so that expectations and boundaries are established early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Sitting on the other side of a class for the first time, the biggest learning was how demanding a teaching job can be. If all goes well, it can certainly have its highs. At the end of the day, I can only hope that being in my class made a positive difference in someone’s life, either personally or professionally.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;food-for-thought&quot;&gt;Food for thought:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 This is a contentious point and gets written about a lot: while universities get more and more commercialised, students adopt a more customer-centric attitude. This shift raises questions about maintaining an honest, mutual two-way understanding between educators and students without fear of retribution. I’ve read a few posts online where lecturers talk about being caught in the middle (bullying students and dismissive management), and it honestly doesn’t sound like a recipe for long-term learning and development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 I’m not sure what the data on this suggests, but looking at learning from the other side of the table, I can’t help but speak in favour of selective classes at the tertiary level. I’ve seen bright students get dragged down by mediocre ones who have no interest in the subject or learning in general. There needs to be access to good-quality education for everyone but universities simply can’t be the place where poor parenting and educational deficiencies can be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 There seems to be an explosion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/emerge-edtech-insights/challenger-universities-pt-3a-the-challenger-university-landscape-f7300bce7db2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘challenger’ universities&lt;/a&gt; that cater to different needs. Whilst there are some proven, long-established ones like the African Leadership University, and more recent, interesting ones like the London Interdisciplinary School, I’m doubtful of institutions that create degrees to cater to a job market (I’ve seen places that offer degrees in product management, for example). The latter might help short-term, but education, learning, and universities, especially in a world where things change constantly, cater to different needs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Career-Arts-College-Credentials-Connections/dp/0691239797/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1FXA014PP11Y2&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.n2zTXwYwl6uK4Q6HPEGTvvHADfe_fpcXEAyNTCAL-pTBwKPHbh6JLyOASiaxRoUnKCf9NnBFFGO_fd2le-wUjt2NkhXwHN_XvuTEbXICPOpeANWWn67HKtgodIcrOYAwxK5GvBOKzKdubaTm9C6GgqDucULyeLma0qszxOtDouUMfOIMy-60eoR8FH82txr2PbunbevATMqFXIbD65qa_sbMwTH7kZb-ddBlFTjmKxM.qLA8VIs13cg6VYyjkTJpWOZq2TB5ZHySh9g_p4rfPVE&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=career+arts+ben&amp;amp;qid=1716721230&amp;amp;sprefix=career+arts+ben%2Caps%2C772&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Career Arts&lt;/a&gt; by Ben Wildavsky makes a much more convincing argument for why traditional colleges and vocational avenues such as bootcamps exist. Essentially, Wildavsky says that colleges and universities provide a foundation for critical thinking and intellectual pursuits whereas bootcamps and other vocational certifications act as valuable add-ons to one’s career. In this spirit, it shouldn’t be an either/or decision and any degree that doesn’t teach you the fundamentals of learning or create an environment for personal growth is best avoided. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nandu Rajagopala</name><email>nandu.rajagopala@cantab.net</email></author><summary type="html">As far as new learnings and experiences go, this month is a milestone of sorts.

Having spent some time researching how people learn, talking to potential users, building/testing a prototype, and refining my pitch for a competitive startup grant that I was shortlisted for, I thought I’d summarise some lessons that I learnt from the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/Prototype.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/Prototype.png&quot; alt=&quot;ScienceQuests prototype&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;An initial prototype of ScienceQuests&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-a-problem&quot;&gt;Identifying a problem:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 It isn’t enough to solve a problem; the key question is whether you are tackling a problem that customers would pay money to have solved. It can be sometimes difficult to separate signals from noise; is there really a problem or do you just want there to be a problem? Or are you force-fitting a pet solution onto what seems like a problem? In the world of parents and schools and education, the guiding light, unfortunately, is grades in an important exam, not learning for its own sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 It’s wise to spend some time selecting a problem to work on. I’m not just talking about founder-market fit, but the decision-making process behind selecting what you want to work on. Did you, for example, wade through lots of ideas, weigh them, maybe test some assumptions, and then commit? Or did you go for the first idea that made business sense to you? I’m sure there isn’t a right or wrong answer here, but spending some time on brainstorming and idea selection can make life easier later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Sometimes it’s better to explore, build, learn, and come to your own conclusion. I remember speaking early on with an EdTech founder who warned me that the sector can be challenging. I have since heard it mentioned multiple times. But, having done your research, if you think you have a unique insight, have differentiated skills, and are passionate about the sector/problem, it’s always best to have a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-research-and-prototyping&quot;&gt;User research and prototyping:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Sourcing and interacting with users for research can give you a glimpse of the sales process. It’s also a good opportunity to check if you’d enjoy having your intended audience as customers and if you can bring yourself to empathise with them. If there isn’t some sort of connection, I doubt if anyone would be able to withstand headwinds when times get tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Knowing how to code can be a double-edged sword and can stop you from thinking about the smallest possible thing that can be built to test your idea/hypothesis. For ScienceQuests, although the landing page saw an organic 20% conversation (email signups to visits), I found that it was easier to set up research interviews when there was a promise of something to see/do. In fact, having a couple of kids try out the prototype and gather feedback in real time was eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-the-right-co-founder&quot;&gt;Finding the right co-founder:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Everyone says this and I’ll just re-iterate: finding a co-founder who is the right fit is hard. Although some online platforms can help (e.g. Y-Combinator’s), they aren’t a magic pill since the vast majority are just silent observers. I’m not entirely sure if I agree with this but I’ve seen it mentioned that the ability to attract a co-founder with only the promise of equity is in itself a way of validating an idea. I say I’m not sure because it really depends on the other party’s interests and knowledge of the sector. In a world where too many individual contributors get promoted to leadership roles, I was also amazed by how many wanted to be CEOs without ever having worked in an operational role before and/or having the ability to empathise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-against-the-world&quot;&gt;You against The World:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 In an ever-changing world, being a generalist or, at least having the ability to be skills-fluid, is under-appreciated. In fact, I think in certain societies, it is sometimes looked at with near suspicion or worse, a disqualification. Innovation comes from the mix-and-match of the things you’ve been exposed to and, given the multiple tasks I had to juggle (prototyping to research to marketing), I was glad for some of the varied experiences that I’ve been fortunate enough to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉🏽 Sometimes, it’s less about you or your idea, but more about you being in the right place at the right time with the right people. A lot of things need to be in place to get things off the ground, and some might not even be in your control. For example, even if you have a wide network with relevant expertise, not everyone might be in the same phase in life as you are to join as a co-founder. Whether you go on to build a large business or your idea fizzles out at the outset, it is important to have that sense of humility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nandu Rajagopala</name><email>nandu.rajagopala@cantab.net</email></author><summary type="html">I spent the second half of 2023 building ScienceQuests (a gamified web app to help kids learn science) and exploring ways of making online learning more effective and engaging for kids.

&lt;p&gt;How do you know if an idea has wings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent a considerable amount of time working with various founders—from newly-minted PhDs to those with corporate experience—I’m constantly amazed by the leaps of faith that they have taken. Sometimes, their efforts have paid off and their ventures have found steady ground. Sometimes, not so. And, frankly, I have at times asked myself what signals they looked at to convince themselves about their startup idea before investing the time, money and effort they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m aware of the ‘test and learn’ methodology that books such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses/dp/0670921602/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1678444397&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have popularised. But what if you have multiple ideas that you want to test out? Isn’t ideation all about generating several ideas and then comparing and contrasting them? Do you build landing pages and prototypes for each and test the market reaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Teresa Torres’ book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Continuous-Discovery-Habits-Discover-Products/dp/1736633309/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1678444194&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continuous Discovery Habits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a simple solution for anyone faced with this dilemma: test assumptions instead of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have previously written about building an assignment tool and realising that it wouldn’t have been an ideal solution for teachers who had gotten used to mainstream tools offered by Google Classrooms and Microsoft Assignment during the pandemic &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If I were to take my own experience as an example, this is how I would have done things differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generate many ideas that can be compared and contrasted in the homework-assigning space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Story map a selected idea with the main actors and their journey within the product idea in question&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tease out the assumptions behind each step of the user journey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the assumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-with-several-ideas&quot;&gt;Working with several ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the assignment tool, the first mistake I made was not spending enough time on ideation or problem-scoping: I went with the first idea that came to my mind without generating enough alternatives in the opportunity space (How might we reduce teachers’ workloads?). I also relied on my own school experience to empathise with teachers and didn’t speak to any of them to understand their underlying needs. The first idea we come up with is generally not the best; the deeper we dig into the crevices of our minds, the more innovative our ideas tend to be. And, to whittle them down, ideas are meant to be compared and contrasted against one another (either on your own or as a group).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If making the homework process more efficient was the ultimate goal, the following diagram outlines the key areas that make it so from a teacher’s perspective. The highlighted part is the pain point that I was focusing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/homework_pains.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/homework_pains.png&quot; alt=&quot;Homework pain points&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pain points involved in assigning homework (click to enlarge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For illustration, some ideas that solve the marking/reporting problem are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a web app to set and score assignments to an entire class &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a mobile app that enables students to capture and submit homework; assignments marked by AI or some outsourced entity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chatbot that allows interactive learning discussion to solidify concepts learnt at school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the above ideas all address the same problem, the underlying assumptions across all these ideas should be broadly similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generating-assumptions&quot;&gt;Generating assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve narrowed your list of ideas to the three that address the problem at hand, an effective means of understanding underlying assumptions is to pick one, pretend the product exists and story map the typical user journey. Below is a sketch that fleshes out what this journey might have looked like for an assignment-setting tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/story_map.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/story_map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Assignment tool story map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Story map (click to enlarge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions, according to Torres, fall under five key buckets: desirability (do users want this?), viability (would users pay for this?), usability (can users find their way around the product?), feasibility (can we actually build this?) and ethics (are we allowed to do this?). Looking at each action through the prism of a major assumption category allows you to quickly generate a series of assumptions that you are taking at each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve listed out some key assumptions that I’d subconsciously made when starting to flesh out the idea &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;li&gt; Teachers are happy to set their own questions&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt; Teachers are happy to restrict themselves to MCQs and one-word answer questions&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Feasibility &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;Our engineers can build a solution where students at a particular school can view all their classes, assignments and scores o submitted assignments&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; Ethics &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
          &lt;ol start=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Schools/parents are happy with the idea of online homework and extra screen time&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of things, not all assumptions are equal; some can sink your idea whilst others are just details you should be aware of when fleshing out the business model/operations. An easy way to focus on the ones that matter is to map out these assumptions in a grid as below (importance versus evidence; evidence referring to how much evidence we currently have to prove/disprove the assumption) and select the top three that hold sway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/assumption_map.png&quot; width=&quot;95%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Assumption map (click to enlarge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this diagram, it appears as though assumptions #5, #6 and #7 are the ones that we should gather more evidence for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-assumptions&quot;&gt;Testing assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;assumption → simulate → evaluate&lt;/em&gt; framework provides a roadmap for testing assumptions. Given that the goal is to reduce risk and not to prove an assumption as being true, the process is simple: pick one of your leap-of-faith assumptions, identify a moment you want to simulate, and evaluate the outcome against pre-determined criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, for example, I were to test assumptions #6 and #7 (‘There are enough schools that would pay for a digital solution’ and ‘We can easily reach and market to schools’), one way to accomplish that would be to create a fake brochure/website with a pricing plan, reach out to various school heads via different channels and assess what the response rate is (e.g., email sign-ups). If you have a pre-determined number of positive responses that would make the test pass (e.g., 5 out of 10 schools respond positively to our request), then that should provide a benchmark for you to know what success should look like. It will also give you an insight into the effectiveness of different sales/marketing channels and if you could scale via that channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you determine the correct response rate that should tip the balance? Unfortunately, the exact number is subjective and it’s best to arrive at one as a team. But it is important that you start small and then progress to large-scale tests. If you have an existing digital product and you want to assess the assumptions behind a particular feature, you could always run one-question surveys (e.g., ‘Do you want off-the-shelf assignments to pick from on our platform?’) or A/B tests as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing that you take away from this article, let it be this: don’t test whole ideas. When you are toying between a couple of ideas, identify the assumptions behind them and then devise tests to assess the risk of that assumption. That way, you can save some time, money and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Note that all the assumptions are framed in a positive way. It makes it easier when it comes to devising tests. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking with users is a topic that is layered enough to fill an entire book. In fact, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; entire books dedicated to the subject; The Mom Test and Continuous Discovery Habits are popular examples that cover the topic in detail. This being a chronicle of sorts, I will stick to some of the techniques I used and the tips and tricks that I made note of (and tried to apply) from various different sources. Since we are talking about deep dives to figure out what to build (that is, the initial phase of product development), customer interviews are an integral research technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as interviews go, there are three areas that determine their effectiveness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sourcing the right people to speak with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asking the right questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Synthesising the takeaways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sourcing&quot;&gt;Sourcing:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sourcing enough people to interview is one of the trickiest parts of the research process: where do you find enough target users to talk to? Your goal is to talk to all those who might be using your software. If the product already has users and/or your users are in your immediate midst, you have your work cut out for you. Otherwise, you might have to recruit them from your personal network or through adverts (perhaps with a voucher as an incentive). In the case of the job board that I was working on, the paying customer was the employer and to get a good grasp of the opportunities (customers pains, desires and needs that serve as opportunities for us to fill a gap), I had to speak with hiring managers from different types of companies, mostly sourced through personal networks, Slack groups etc. Job-hunters was another group to speak with; this was relatively straightforward as (a) I could empathise with this group and (b) I had some access via personal networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interview-mechanics&quot;&gt;Interview mechanics:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge in user research is the mechanics to follow when conducting the interview: what do you ask, what do you not ask and so on. Bear in mind that asking for stories that elicit behaviour is always going to trump opinions. Torres (author of Continuous Discovery Habits) gives an example here. Asking someone what factors they consider when buying a pair of jeans (i.e. for hard facts) would result in a rationalised answer: that is, what they think they do. But if you ask someone to describe how they went about buying jeans the last time that they went shopping, you encourage them to tell you their actions, their behaviours, what really happened on the ground. Recalling facts is a process that is rife with cognitive biases and the human brain is remarkable at creating coherent (but not necessarily accurate) stories that deceive us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How then does one come up with the right questions to ask? The first step is to differentiate between research questions and interview questions. The former is essentially: What needs/pains/desires matter most to this customer? The latter, in fact, revolves around stories and plot points. Before beginning to interview users, it might be wise to sketch out the typical &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2010/11/using-customer-journey-maps-to&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; faced by the user: the key user actions/intentions, the emotions felt and the expectations at each stage. You could draft an initial version based on your experience and tweak once you’ve spoken to a few people. Once interviews are scheduled, focus on stories (“Tell me about the last time you…” type questions), varying the focus as you see fit (e.g. Do you want to focus on a specific entertainment provider such as Netflix or entertainment in general?). Once a customer starts talking about their experience, it might be useful to use story nodes (i.e. the key phases in a customer journey) as a guide to dig deep. As a guide: every story has a protagonist, a beginning/middle/end, and other characters. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/xp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/xp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Customer experience map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Customer experience map&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another best practice when interviewing is to do so, where possible, as a trio (product manager, designer, engineer). The more diversity that you have in the room, the more lived-in experiences you’d have to generate more insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Map out a typical customer experience map &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Focus on stories: these could be open-ended or more specific &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Excavate using story nodes and plot-points; use the experience map as a guide &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interview-synthesis&quot;&gt;Interview synthesis:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step in the process is to synthesise the takeaways from the interview. The recommended approach is to do so via snapshots at the end of each interview. I’ve annotated a sample from one of the interviews that I conducted (based on a structure recommended by Torres).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/int-notes.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/int-notes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interview synthesis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you are at the initial stages of product development, one of the goals of story excavation is to find out how pressing the problem is for the user. Asking what they do at the moment is a good way to find out if your idea is a nice-to-have or a must-have. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly does a product manager do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a job advert for a product manager at a European startup. A few weeks later, I noticed that the job title had changed to ‘Technical Product Manager‘ while the job description remained very much the same. Thanks to LinkedIn’s recommendation engine, about a month later, I realised the same company was now looking for a Product Owner (yes, you guessed it right: the job description hadn’t budged an inch). Something seemed off: either this particular company was using the job title as a keyword to generate as many applications as possible, or they were genuinely confused about the role of product within their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was against this backdrop that I listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lennyspodcast.com/the-nature-of-product-marty-cagan-silicon-valley-product-group/#transcript&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; where Marty Cagan &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; talks about the role of product teams and where most companies get it wrong. Cagan says that there is a distinct difference between a product team and a features team: the former are given problems to solve (be it company or customer-related) as well as the functional skills required to tackle them, whereas the latter are simply given a roadmap and a list of features to build. The number of features churned out is immaterial if they do not solve the underlying problems that the company faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve summarised below some of my other takeaways from the podcast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Cagan, only 10-15% of companies are good product companies. The issue—Cagan quotes an old interview of Steve Jobs here—is that even organisations that start in the right direction lose their mojo as they grow and their products start generating revenue. Once they reach this comfort zone, most companies tend to prioritise functions such as marketing and finance, and product discovery takes a back seat. Apparently, this ‘disease’ is a stumbling block to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cagan also suggests a model for product teams to work effectively. Once a problem has been validated and a solution is being discovered, it is the product manager’s responsibility to ensure that whatever the team decides upon is &lt;strong&gt;valuable&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;viable&lt;/strong&gt;. The engineering and design teams would, for their part, assess the feasibility (can we build this solution?) and usability (can the user easily accomplish the task?) of the solution respectively. This means that a product manager should have direct access to customers, the engineering team and the various stakeholders. Cagan says that this direct and unencumbered access is non-negotiable and a prerequisite for a product manager to succeed in their role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Useful tip: When you do user research, you do it to find out all the reasons why users &lt;strong&gt;won’t&lt;/strong&gt; use your product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Product managers should be well-versed in four areas: the users and the customers; how the product is being used; how the product fits into the bigger picture of the organisation; and, the overall industry and competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the startup that has now settled on the Product Owner title, Cagan has some choice words. He says the product owner role (when separate) is an ‘administrative role’ parading as a product role. According to him, teaching a process like scrum by an Agile coach doesn’t make someone product-oriented and it is Europe that seems obsessed with such roles/titles. 🤷🏽‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The task at hand was to define what to build: understand the user problems, craft the value proposition, and define the core features that might be required for an MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on this project got me thinking: could one standardise the process of building compelling products? Was there a ‘loose’ one-size-fits-all strategy to creating something that hasn’t yet achieved product-market fit? I say loose in inverted commas because I am aware that building products is both a science as well as an art, and that context would play a role in any process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a first-iteration recipe, I combed through popular product books such as &lt;em&gt;Well-Designed&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Customer Discovery Habits&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lean Product Playbook&lt;/em&gt;, and blended some of the concepts outlined. The posts in this series not only capture some of the key takeaways from these books but also provide applied examples that demonstrate how some of the techniques could be used in real life. I have leant towards a more user-centred approach that focuses on customer opportunities (needs, desires, pain points). I feel that such an approach encourages exploration and places more weight on innovation/differentiation (rather than the popular lean process of building something quickly, flinging it out to the market and seeing if the product in question sinks or swims). I’m not advocating one school of product development over another, but spending extra time to get under the skin of the user/customer resonated with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 5 steps to building compelling products:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Understand the market to carve out a space &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Dig deep via customer interviews &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Map opportunities to business outcomes. Use this to formulate solutions and assumptions &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Identify the core features for the product in question; also, performance drivers and differentiators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Build a prototype, gather feedback and reiterate &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;🎯 TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Identify the different communities of users for your product, hang out with them (online or offline) to assess likes/dislikes/trends, and mull over things (with the help of some frameworks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Well-Designed&lt;/em&gt;, Kolko puts forward the idea of a market as being a community of people (users, policy-makers, competitors etc), and the often-used phrase ‘product-market fit’ as being how this community responds to the product in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to thus understand the market is to hang out within its different communities (of users) and look out for signals that could help in crafting a compelling product differentiator. Example: What do these people currently do and how do they do it? What do these people gripe about? What do they wish for? And more importantly: Are there any major shifts in attitude and practices?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signals, when taken as a whole, can give rise to unique insights about a market and enable you to carve out a spot for yourself. In my case, the nature of the product that I was looking into—consumer-driven, marketplace for talent, something all of us could relate to—made empathising with the user more straightforward. Having done a coding bootcamp, I also had ready access to an active alumni community hunting for opportunities in tech and was broadly aware of the topics that were usually discussed. I have also previously written about studying a user group that I was interested in through actively engaging in relevant Facebook groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But be aware that some signals such as competition and what they are up to are merely noise. It is, of course, useful to know something about what you are up against but concentrating too much on what others are doing distracts you from what they aren’t. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to replicate the &lt;em&gt;character&lt;/em&gt; of a product that a competitor has built which in itself is a reflection of the company’s culture and values (Microsoft products, for example, are very different to those of Apple). Blindly keeping track of features and copying them, in addition, only results in a poor user experience. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gathered your signals, you can use certain tools to make sense of them. The tools or, as Kolco calls them, working artifacts help you mull things over and slip into a sense of exploration. They can also help you filter out signals that don’t fit in with your broader goals. For those exposed to consulting frameworks, these tools aren’t exactly used to communicate your ideas/findings to anyone, but to doodle, explore options and get into a creative headspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve outlined below some of the tools that I used to consider my vision/strategy: value-goal statements, user-attribute matrices and pre-mortems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;color: black; font-weight:bold; margin-top: 20px;&quot;&gt; Value-goal statement: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I building the product? How would this fit into universal themes such as love, connection, respect, pride etc? Thinking of yourself being in charge of a value rather than a product can be a means of filtering what you don’t want to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example: &lt;em&gt;I help connect untapped tech talent in Africa with world-class opportunities in Europe. Unlike LinkedIn, our talent profiles are internally vetted and the employers who use our site are actively looking to hire African talent.&lt;/em&gt; Essentially: plugging the gap between talent and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;color: black; font-weight:bold; margin-top: 20px;&quot;&gt; User-attribute matrices: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are 2-by-2 diagrams to tease out any relations between different communities. The first step is to identify the different groups of users who might be using your product. The second is to ascertain what differentiates them so that you can make a list of factual and emotional attributes. The third is to plot these attributes against one another to generate insights: areas that are best avoided or best explored from a positioning perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt; These steps are best illustrated by an example. For a job board focused on tech talent the users would be: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt; Table 1: Community of users for a job board &lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Supply&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Demand&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; fresh grads (either university or bootcamp)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Startups (founders, engineering lead)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; - Early-stage: focus on MVPs etc &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; - Scale-ups: established product-market fit, and tech teams&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; professionals (full-time or freelancers) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large corporations (HR, hiring manager)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; - Tech as focus: SaaS &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; - Tech as an enabler: banks, government organisations, charities, companies in traditional sectors going for a digital presence&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting agencies (Headhunters)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web/design agencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt; Comparing one group against another might help generate attributes. For example: what would differentiate a resource-strapped, growing startup from an established company? It might be the budget available or the level of supervision that can be afforded to a new hire or it could be the flexibility when it comes to where you can work from. The table below summarises some of the attributes that I came up with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt; Table 2: Relevant attributes for the user group &lt;/caption&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; Cost of hiring (budget available)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over fit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quality of work produced &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over work output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; Level of supervision required &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over working mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; Work location &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sense of working together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; Availability/variety of profiles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt; User segment size &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the above attributes, the charts below depict some of the possible combinations. Mulling over them raises questions such as: Is there an opportunity amongst companies with a low budget but don’t have a strong focus on team culture (something like a SWAT team that goes in to work on a specified project/problem) or should we position ourselves as offering bright developers who don’t have much experience to companies on a shoestring budget. If it’s the latter, would that even work in practise considering that hiring managers automatically reject people without a prescribed length of experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this product fails in the future, why would that have happened? Asking yourself this question early on forces you to visualise scenarios that could crop up in the future and thereby refine your offering before you go-to-market. In my case, these were some of the issues that I could identify:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Companies not being open to temporary, remote staff, either because of policy or security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not able to source enough local talent who meet Western company specs (i.e. not enough relevant experience, knowledge of the right languages)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talent not performing on the job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Costs of the new hire not a dealbreaker to most  tech companies, whereas capability is&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pricing not in line with employer expectations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apart from cost, the product doesn’t offer anything new compared with other tech-focused job sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap things up, the first step in building a product is immersing yourself in your target market and getting a feel for the macro picture: community trends and market forces. The next step is to deep-dive into individual behaviour and understand the needs and wants on a micro level.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;One example is the increased interest shown in politics by young people which was instrumental in helping Obama win the 2008 presidential election. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

up the goal of a landing page as showing users where to go and providing
answers to the following three questions as being key to achieving that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; What is this? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; What’s in it for me? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; What do I do next? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When crafting my own landing page to test an idea, I used Marsh’s questions
as a framework to structure the information. The only addition that I made was
to incorporate a unique value proposition to the first question (What is this
and what is special about it?). For those interested in the mechanics of
design, I used Figma to create an initial mock before building the page. I’m
aware that there are no-code alternatives like Webflow etc, but my design was
simple enough for me to write the code myself and it didn’t take me too much
time to have it in place. The icons that you see are from Icons8 and they are
available free of charge (Figma enabled me to combine and adapt them to my own
needs). I remember spending some time playing around with the colours but I
finally went with what felt right (some of it was based on the icon designer’s
colour palette).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of a landing page ultimately boils down to its conversion
rate. I didn’t spend money on any Google or Facebook ads, but as outlined in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://nandu306.github.io/articles/idea_validation&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post, I targeted the right users through relevant Facebook groups. The
conversation rate (sign-ups to views) was around 20% but this might have well
been lower had I tried to test willingness-to-pay and quoted a product cost
somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve annotated my landing page to highlight some of the key takeaways. Reflecting on it now, I’d
probably keep it problem-centric and avoid hinting at solutions (I’ve mentioned a gamified environment, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I realised when trying to figure out what to build was how experimental, iterative, and subjective the whole process tends to be. I doubt if anyone who launches a successful product ever does so fully knowing what form it would finally take or if it would ever go down as intended with their target user base. Of course, there are well-known examples of now household brands having to change course when they first started: Instagram, for example, began as a location-sharing app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But reading is one thing and living through it is another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have summarised below my experience in figuring out what to build in the EdTech space and the lessons it reinforced. I call it reinforced because, through reading/classes, etc., some version of these lessons had been wedged in my head but being in the thick of things brought them to the fore and threw a whole new set of challenges that showed product discovery in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-one-first-own-the-problem-space&quot;&gt;Lesson One: First, own the problem space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh from a coding bootcamp, I was raging to put my newfound skills to practice. I plunged into action and settled for one of the first product ideas that came to my mind: an online assessment tool for school teachers. Given the media coverage of the pandemic’s adverse effects on school education at the time, I suspect that the world around me might have subconsciously influenced me. That, and a soft spot for the education sector in general. The goal was to improve my coding skills; why bother thinking too much about what I was going to build?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idea in place, I rolled my sleeves and started building the web app. The struggles faced in this endeavour and the associated learnings should be an entire article in its own right but suffice it to say that once I had emerged from many a rabbit hole that I had dug for myself, I had a shiny new tool that (a) looked good (I had paid attention to basic UX/UI) and (b) did what it was meant to do. My line of thinking about the product being a non-issue would have been fine if I had stopped it at that. Alas, not. Chuffed by what I had managed to build on my own and swept away by my optimism, I reached out to a few schools and set up meetings to show them my handiwork. For some reason, in that adrenaline-fuelled moment, the image that I had in mind of a teacher was the one that I had encountered at school: not very tech-savvy nor open to embracing the tools of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/mojo-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/mojo-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Teachers' dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Teachers’ Dashboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/mojo-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/mojo-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Assignment setting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Assignment setting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public/mojo-3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/mojo-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Students' Dasnboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Students’ Dashboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an awakening when, after patiently listening to my product demo, the first teacher asked me how it differed from Google Classrooms. I remember mumbling about the app being more intuitive and easier to use. But, I knew in my heart that it was not a compelling reason for anyone to undertake a significant shift in their way of working. Another conversation with another school went the same way. It took a moment of discomfort to sink in that schools had adapted for the pandemic and that I was putting the cart before the horse. Indirectly, I’d embodied what those with some technical skills fall prey to: rushing to build. I should have first immersed myself in that space, identifying schools’ needs/problems/desires and whether they were painful enough for them to resolve by paying money. The target user base and their problems should have come first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversations weren’t a total disaster though. I switched gears halfway through and used the opportunity to find out more about the issues teachers faced when setting homework. I learnt that creating assessment material/questions was time-consuming and that marking long-form answers was another. These were problems not addressed by products such as Google Classrooms or Microsoft Teams, and would probably never be. However, I knew many products in the market addressed these issues in various ways. Was there a gap in the market? Or was there something that current players don’t cater fully to? My curiosity now stoked, I parked my app to one side and tried to better understand the secondary schools space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-two-get-creative-when-trying-to-understand-and-connect-with-your-target-audience&quot;&gt;Lesson Two: Get creative when trying to understand and connect with your target audience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have had crude luck when sourcing teachers for my first two conversations. Or I could only get their attention by referring to the product I had built. I quickly discovered that cold emails where I asked for time for research mostly went unanswered. Even the attempts to source conversations through my networks were unsuccessful: the teachers were either sceptical about confidentiality issues or couldn’t find time to chat. Perhaps it might have been different if I had given some incentive such as gift vouchers, but I didn’t want to go down that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching for alternative means of connecting with the target user base, I discovered several Facebook groups that brought together teachers with various interests and backgrounds. There were several for science teachers, online tutors, and even one for parents prepping their children for competitive school exams. I joined all the groups I could find including related ones like those for parents who homeschool their children. I now had a means of engaging with the people I had been struggling to connect with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few weeks taking a back seat and quietly reading some of the posts that cropped up in the group and the comments those posts garnered. One of the science groups was particularly active; the posts ranged from asking where to find assessment questions to ideas for practical work to help with lesson planning. Once I figured out the lay of the land, I posted a simple question to the group: What were their biggest issues when it came to teaching science?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by the number of responses generated within a few hours on a Sunday morning, I had struck a chord. Replies ranged from the workload associated with ongoing assessments to how broken science teaching at school was (“My degree is in biology, but I have to teach physics as well”; “We just don’t have the time to make science relevant”; “I sometimes have to teach maths as well because the maths teacher hasn’t covered the topic yet.”). Having been a science student myself, I could relate to why providing an effective science lesson was a challenge to most teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replies from science teachers allowed me to think a bit more about what they were trying to achieve, or as a popular framework puts it, their ‘jobs to be done’ when teaching science. I could garner enough empathy to see the other side of the coin as well; the jobs students were trying to get done when trying to learn science. Merging them gave me an inkling of an idea to test. But which segment do I focus on? Should I build a product for schools/teachers (i.e., B2B) or should it be something for students (B2C)? My experience in trying to source teachers for interviews was eye-opening and made me rethink who I wanted to target. If having a simple conversation with schools and teachers was so arduous, how difficult would sales be when it comes to that stage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, to test my hypothesis, I created a landing page highlighting some key problems (distilled from my user research) and shared the web link on the Facebook groups I was part of. Within a week, I had about fifty people who had signed up to receive a notification on launch. Fifty with whom I could have one-on-one conversations to refine the idea or stumble upon new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
