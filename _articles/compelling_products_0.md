I recently undertook a project for a German-backed upskilling provider in West Africa, the intention being to explore ways of connecting tech talent in the continent with companies in Europe. I didn’t get a chance to evaluate the market attractiveness of going down this route (this was not part of the scope) and the task at hand was to define what to build: understanding the user problems, crafting the value proposition, and defining the core features that might be required for an MVP. Working on this project got me thinking: could one standardise the process of building compelling products? Was there a ‘loose’ one-size-fits all strategy to creating something that hasn’t yet achieved product-market fit? I say loose in inverted commas because I am aware that building products is both a science as well as an art, and that context would play a role in any process.

To create a first-iteration recipe, I combed through some popular product books such as _Well-Designed_, _Customer Discovery Habits_ and _The Lean Product Playbook_, and blended some of the concepts outlined. This blog post not only captures some of the key takeaways from these books for my future reference but also provides applied examples that demonstrate how some of the techniques could be used in real-life. I have leant towards a more user-centred approach that focuses on customer opportunities (needs, desires, pain-points). I feel that such an approach encourages exploration and places more weight on innovation/differentiation (rather than the popular lean process of building something quickly, flinging it out to the market and seeing if the product in question sinks or swims). I’m not advocating one school of product development over another, but spending some extra time to get under the skin of the user/customer resonated with me.


  <li> 1. Understand the market to carve out a space </li>
  <li> 2. Dig-deep via customer interviews </li>
  <li> 3. Map opportunities to business outcome. Use this to formulate solutions and assumptions </li>
  <li> 4. Identify the core features for the product in question; also, performance-drivers and differentiators </li>
  <li> 5. Build a prototype and gather feedback </li>
