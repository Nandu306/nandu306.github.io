title: Designing a landing page test
description: Building products that resonate with the user is the holy-grail of the start-up world and a landing page test is a popular way of testing an idea. But how does one increase the chances of a successful test?

In _UX For Beginners: A Crash Course in 100 Short Lessons_, Joel Marsh sums
up the goal of a landing page as showing users where to go and providing
answers to the following three questions as being key to achieving that:


<li> What is this? </li> {: style="color: #8e8e8e;margin: 20px 0 0 0;line-height: 1.9;font-size: 15px;padding-right: 10px;margin-top: 10px;" }
<li> What’s in it for me? </li> {: style="color: #8e8e8e;margin: 20px 0 0 0;line-height: 1.9;font-size: 15px;padding-right: 10px;margin-top: 10px;" }
<li> What do I do next? </li>{: style="color: #8e8e8e;margin: 20px 0 0 0;line-height: 1.9;font-size: 15px;padding-right: 10px;margin-top: 10px;" }


When crafting my own landing page to test an idea, I used Marsh’s questions
as a framework to structure the information. The only addition that I made was
to incorporate a unique value proposition to the first question (What is this
and what is special about it?). For those interested in the mechanics of
design, I used Figma to create an initial mock before building the page. I’m
aware that there are no-code alternatives like Webflow etc, but my design was
simple enough for me to write the code myself and it didn’t take me too much
time to have it in place. The icons that you see are from Icons8 and they are
available free of charge (Figma enabled me to combine and adapt them to my own
needs). I remember spending some time playing around with the colours but I
finally went with what felt right (some of it was based on the icon designer’s
colour palette).

The effectiveness of a landing page ultimately boils down to its conversion
rate. I didn’t spend money on any Google or Facebook ads, but as outlined in
[this](https://nandu306.github.io/articles/idea_validation) post, I targeted the right users through relevant Facebook groups. The
conversation rate (sign-ups to views) was around 20% but this might have well
been lower had I tried to test willingness-to-pay and quoted a product cost
somewhere.

I've annotated my landing page to highlight some of the key takeaways. Reflecting on it now, I'd
probably keep it problem-centric and avoid hinting at solutions (I've mentioned a gamified environment, for example).
