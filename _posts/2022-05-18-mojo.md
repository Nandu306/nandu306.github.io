An online assignment-setting tool for school teachers. Students are invited via
email and can join classes that are available for their year group at their
school. Teachers can create classes as required and set assignments consisting
of various questions (including an image) and answer choices. Students receive
grades upon assignment submission and teachers obtain a markbook with
student performance and average scores.

Built using Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PostgreSQL.
