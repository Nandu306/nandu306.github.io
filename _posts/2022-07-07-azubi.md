Azubi, backed by Deutsche Bildung, provides upskilling courses in coding and web development in West Africa. Since the business model in place was success-based, I explored products that would increase job placement and generate additional upfront revenue streams for the business. The work not only involved big-picture strategic analyses but also touched on various aspects of the product development lifecycle.

Areas covered: Product Development, Design Thinking, Market and Competitor Research, UX/UI, Product Vision/Strategy and Financial Analysis
